# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

To predict the telecom customers who are likely to exit the contract and also to generate patterns
of Churn and non-churn to assist the management to take appropriate decisions to limit churn.

Most telecom companies suffer from voluntary churn. Churn rate has strong impact on the life
time value of the customer because it affects the length of service and the future revenue of the
company. It is estimated that 75 percent of the 17 to 20 million subscribers signing up with a new
wireless carrier every year are coming from another wireless provider, which means they are
churners.
